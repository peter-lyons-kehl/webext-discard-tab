# Discard Tab

This add-on allows discarding (freezing) tabs via right-click.

[Install for Mozilla Firefox from addons.mozilla.org](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/discard-tab/)


Discarding, or freezing, tabs removes them from memory and stops all background activity.
The tab will still exist and once you click the tab again, it will reload.

## Configuration

1. Once installed, locate this add-on within your Firefox add-ons:
   - Firefox toolbar > right side > menu button ("hamburger menu", a button with three horizontal
     lines) > Add-ons and themes,
   - or Firefox top horizontal menu > Tools > Add-ons and themes
2. Locate "Discard Tab"
3. tab Preferences > to indicate which tab has been discarded, check: [] "Prepend snowflake to
   discarded tabs."
